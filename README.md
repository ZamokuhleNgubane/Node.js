Introduction to Node.js:

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it possible to run JavaScript on the server-side. This has revolutionized web development by enabling developers to use the same language (JavaScript) for both client-side and server-side programming.
One of the key advantages of Node.js is its non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking the execution thread. This is achieved through asynchronous event-driven architecture, making Node.js highly efficient for handling I/O-heavy tasks.
Node.js applications are typically written in JavaScript and can be executed via the Node.js runtime environment. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for running JavaScript files, managing packages, and interacting with the Node.js environment.
Node Globals:

Node.js provides several global objects that are accessible from any part of your application. These global objects include global, process, console, Buffer, and others.
The global object in Node.js represents the global namespace, similar to the window object in browsers. However, using global for defining variables or functions globally is discouraged in favor of modular programming.
The process object provides information about the current Node.js process, such as environment variables, command-line arguments, and process-related events. It also allows you to control the execution flow and interact with the operating system.
The console object in Node.js is used for logging messages to the console, which is helpful for debugging and monitoring applications during development and production.
The Buffer class in Node.js is used to handle binary data, such as reading from or writing to files, working with network protocols, and other low-level operations.
Node Modules:

Node.js uses a module system to organize code into reusable components, promoting modularity and maintainability in applications. Modules encapsulate related functionality and can be imported or exported using the module.exports or exports objects.
To create a module, you define your functions, variables, or classes within a file and use module.exports or exports to expose them to other parts of your application.
Node.js provides core modules, such as fs (file system), http, path, util, and others, which are built-in modules available for use without requiring additional installation.
External modules, also known as npm (Node Package Manager) modules, can be installed using npm and managed via the package.json file. These modules extend Node.js functionality and can be easily integrated into your applications using require().

Node File Management and Streams:
Node.js provides the fs (file system) module for file management operations, including reading, writing, appending, deleting, and modifying files and directories.
File operations in Node.js can be performed synchronously (blocking) or asynchronously (non-blocking) using corresponding methods like fs.readFileSync() and fs.readFile().
Asynchronous file operations are preferred in Node.js to maintain non-blocking behavior and improve application performance, especially in I/O-intensive tasks.
Node.js also offers streams, which are objects used to handle data in chunks, rather than loading entire files or data sets into memory at once. This is particularly useful for processing large files, working with network protocols, and streaming data over HTTP or other protocols.

Types of streams in Node.js include:
Readable streams: Used for reading data from a source, such as a file or network.
Writable streams: Used for writing data to a destination, such as a file or network response.
Duplex streams: Combines both readable and writable functionalities, allowing bidirectional data flow.
Transform streams: A type of duplex stream that transforms data as it is read or written, such as compression or encryption streams.
Streams in Node.js support event-driven programming, where you can listen for events such as 'data', 'end', 'error', and 'close' to handle stream operations asynchronously and efficiently.
